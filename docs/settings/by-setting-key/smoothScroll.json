When enabled, scroll animations are calculated with a duration proportional to the scroll distance. When disabled, scrolling uses instant 'behavior' for immediate position changes.

  "notes": "When enabled, the smoothScroll setting works in conjunction with scrollStepSize to determine both the distance and duration of scroll animations. The animation duration is logarithmically scaled (Math.max(100, 20 * Math.log(Math.abs(distance)))) to provide consistent animation speed regardless of scroll distance. When disabled, scrolling behaves instantly with no animation. The setting also interacts with scrollFriction for continuous scroll behavior when keys are held down.",
