The setting is toggled by pressing the 'reset' key (typically Escape) while browsing history results in the Omnibar. The toggle happens in the onReset handler, allowing users to quickly switch between the two sorting strategies during an Omnibar session. The setting persists across sessions and affects all subsequent history queries in the Omnibar. Similar to tabsMRUOrder which controls tab sorting behavior."
