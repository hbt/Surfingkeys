When a user starts typing ':' followed by emoji name characters in an input field, the emoji picker will only display suggestions once this threshold is reached. For example, with a value of 2, typing ':a' shows no suggestions, but ':ab' triggers the picker to display matching emoji. This setting works in conjunction with enableEmojiInsertion, which must be enabled for emoji picking to work at all.",

The threshold parameter is passed directly to the CursorPrompt.activate() method, which uses it to determine when to display emoji suggestions. Lower values (0-1) show suggestions immediately or very quickly, while higher values (3+) require more typing before suggestions appear. This setting affects the emoji insertion feature when users press ':' in text input fields during insert mode."
