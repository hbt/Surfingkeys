## Browser Profiles — CRITICAL LIMITATION

**NEVER suggest using CDP/remote debug port against `gchrb` (the main browser profile).**

| Profile | Remote Debug Port | CDP / dbg proxy / sk-cdp | sk-devtools eval relay |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `gchrb` | ❌ None | ❌ Not available | ✅ Works (requires F12 setup) |
| `gchrb-dev` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

- `gchrb` is the regular daily-use Chrome. Chrome does not allow attaching a remote debug port to an existing profile that wasn't launched with one.
- `gchrb-dev` is a separate profile launched with `--remote-debugging-port`. All CDP tooling (`./bin/sk-cdp`, `./bin/dbg proxy-*`) only works there.
- When the user says "I reloaded the extension in my browser" they mean `gchrb`. There is no debug port there. Do not suggest `sk-cdp eval` or CDP inspection as a debugging step for `gchrb`.
- **When you need to run JS in `gchrb`**, use the sk-devtools eval relay instead (see section below).


## gchrb Debugging — sk-devtools Eval Relay

When CDP is unavailable (i.e. the user is on `gchrb`), use the eval relay: a local HTTP server on `:9600` that forwards JS to the extension's DevTools panel via SSE.

**Setup (one-time per session):**
```bash
./bin/dbg server-start          # Start relay server on :9600
./bin/dbg server-status         # Verify: { "running": true }
```
Then in gchrb: press **F12** → click the **"Surfingkeys"** tab in DevTools. Badge shows `sk-devtools | ● Connected`.

**Check panel is ready:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9600/eval-status | jq .
# Must show: { "panelConnected": true }
```

**Run JS in the service worker:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9600/eval \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"target":"bg","code":"chrome.runtime.id"}' | jq .
```

**Run JS in the inspected page:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9600/eval \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"target":"page","code":"document.title"}' | jq .
```

## Development Commands

### Build vs Reload

| Command | What it does | Use when |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `npm run build:dev` | Build only (no Chrome interaction) | gchrb manual reload, worktree setup, CI |
| `./bin/dbg reload` | Build + reload extension in `gchrb-dev` | Active dev loop with CDP tooling |

After `./bin/dbg reload`, the extension is live in `gchrb-dev`. If the user reloads manually in `gchrb`, run `npm run build:dev` first.

### CDP inspection (gchrb-dev only)

```bash
./bin/sk-cdp eval --target bg "chrome.runtime.id"        # Service worker
./bin/sk-cdp eval --target google.com "document.title"   # Any matching tab
./bin/sk-cdp targets                                      # List all targets
./bin/sk-cdp targets --json                               # Machine-readable
```

### CDP proxy & logging (gchrb-dev only)

```bash
./bin/dbg proxy-start   # Captures all console & exceptions → /tmp/dbg-proxy.log
./bin/dbg proxy-stop
./bin/dbg proxy-status
```

### Full bin/dbg reference

```bash
./bin/dbg reload              # Build + reload extension in gchrb-dev
./bin/dbg proxy-start         # Start CDP proxy → /tmp/dbg-proxy.log
./bin/dbg proxy-stop
./bin/dbg proxy-status
./bin/dbg server-start        # Start sk-devtools relay server on :9600
./bin/dbg server-stop
./bin/dbg server-status
./bin/dbg open-background     # Open SW DevTools console
./bin/dbg errors-list         # List stored extension errors
./bin/dbg errors-clear        # Clear stored extension errors
./bin/dbg config-set          # Set external config file path in storage
./bin/dbg config-clear        # Wipe all config state
./bin/dbg --help              # Full reference
```

See **[docs/dev.md](docs/dev.md)** for the full debugging guide (CDP proxy, debug scripts, sk-cdp).


## Automated Testing

Use Playwright for all new tests. Legacy CDP/Jest tests in `tests/cdp/` are not being extended.

```bash
# Single test
bunx playwright test tests/playwright/commands/cmd-scroll-down.spec.ts

# Single test with V8 coverage
COVERAGE=true bunx playwright test tests/playwright/commands/cmd-scroll-down.spec.ts

# Full suite
npm run test:playwright:parallel
```

### Playwright conventions (enforce strictly)

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| One command per file | Never put two `unique_id`s in one spec |
| File naming | `cmd-<unique_id-with-dashes>.spec.ts` |
| SW vs page target | Tab/bookmark/session commands → SW target; scroll/hints/nav → page target |
| Fixtures | Self-contained — inline styles, no external URLs |
| Known flaky | `cmd-hints-learn-element`, `cmd-visual-document-start`, `cmd-nav-next-link`, `cmd-scroll-half-page-down` — ignore first failure |

See **[tests/playwright/CLAUDE.md](tests/playwright/CLAUDE.md)** for coverage, instrumentation, fixtures, and full template.


## Tab Command Architecture

New tab commands go through the `tabHandleMagic` dispatch system — **not** legacy handlers like `tabOnly`, `tabCloseM`, etc.

Pattern: `closeTabMagic` → `reloadTabMagic` → any new `*TabMagic`

- Handler receives a `direction` (e.g. `CurrentTab`, `DirectionRight`, `DirectionLeft`, `DirectionRightAll`) and `repeats`
- Registered via `mapkey(key, desc, () => RUNTIME(unique_id, { direction, repeats: R }))` in `default.js`
- Dispatched in `start.js` via `commandRegistry`
- Use `var repeats = message.repeats` (not `|| 1` fallback)
- Use `chrome.tabs.query({})` (not `{currentWindow: true}`) to support cross-window magic

When adding a new tab magic command, read `closeTabMagic` as the canonical reference.


## Git Worktrees

Worktrees let you work on a branch in a separate directory without disturbing the main checkout.

### Create a worktree

```bash
git worktree add /home/hassen/workspace/surfingkeys-<branch-name> -b <branch-name>
```

### Required setup after creation

```bash
cd /path/to/new-worktree
npm run worktree:setup   # symlinks node_modules + builds extension
```

> After each cherry-pick or code change, re-run `npm run build:dev` before running tests.

### List / remove worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
git worktree remove /path/to/worktree
```

### Upstream sync workflow

When syncing from `brookhong/Surfingkeys`:
1. Create worktree on a dedicated branch (`upstream-sync`)
2. Run `npm run worktree:setup`
3. Cherry-pick commits one at a time oldest→newest, skipping version bumps
4. For each: review diff → cherry-pick → build → smoke test → full suite
5. Commits that conflict with hbt work go in `upstream-excluded.json` with a reason

```bash
git fetch brookhong
git log master..brookhong/master --oneline   # filter against upstream-excluded.json
```
