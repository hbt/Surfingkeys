    <h1>Sentence Navigation Test</h1>

    <p id="para1">This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence. This is the third sentence here.</p>

    <p id="para2">Another paragraph starts here. It contains multiple sentences too. This makes testing easier for us.</p>

    <p id="para-single">A single sentence paragraph to test with.</p>

    <p id="para-complex">Complex sentence with punctuation! Does it work properly? Yes, it does work. Testing multiple types of punctuation.</p>

    <p id="para-long">This is a very long sentence that extends quite a bit and contains many words to test how backward sentence navigation handles longer text content properly. This is a shorter follow-up sentence. And this is the final sentence in this paragraph for testing purposes.</p>
